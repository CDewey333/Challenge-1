# Challenge-1
Kickstarting with Excel

Overview of Project

	The purpose of this project was to use Excel to analyze different campaigns launch dates and their fundraising goals.

Analysis and Challenges

	Using graphs and filters was extremely helpful in this analysis. A challenge I came across was using the Box and Whisker graph. Not having filters on made this graph unreadable. 

 Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

	The most successful month was May. The summer overall was better. But early summer was the best.

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	
	The lower the goal, the more likely it was to be successful. People want to set a high fundraiser goal so they can have better quality production. But they need to make reductions to get started in the first place. Get the base paid for and make improvements later.

Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

	I struggled with the Countif section. I misread the instructions and was pulling the final criteria from the wrong column. 

Results

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

	For the most success, launch in May. Avoid launching in December. Also set a fundraising goal under $10,000. Most entries did not make above $10,000.

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

	Set a low goal. It may seem cheap, but it works, and has proven results.
 
What are some limitations of this dataset?

	Some limitations are we donâ€™t know if the same people attended multiple events. Maybe different audience circumstances affected fundraising efforts. 

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

	Pie charts could be used to see how much events earned based on genre. This could help narrow down which shows had the most potential per genre.
