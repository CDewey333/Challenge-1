# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to use Excel to analyze the fundraiser data and provide actionable behaviors to use for future fundraisers.

## Analysis and Challenges
Using graphs and filters was extremely helpful in this analysis. A challenge I came across was using the Box and Whisker graph. Not having filters on made this graph unreadable. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The most successful month was May. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The lower the goal, the more likely it was to be successful.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I struggled with the Countif section. I misread the instructions and was pulling the final criteria from the wrong column. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
For the most success, launch in May. Avoid launching in December.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Set a low goal. It may seem cheap, but it works. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations are we don’t know if the same people attended multiple events. Maybe different audience circumstances affected fundraising efforts. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Pie charts could be used to see how much events earned based on genre. This could help narrow down which shows had the most potential per genre.
